Welcome to Tscookbook repository! This project is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and TypeScript. The app allows users to view, manage, and save recipes.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely. Sessions are managed using Express session cookies.

- **Recipe Display**: Browse through a collection of delicious recipes with images, descriptions, and ingredients.

- **Tags and Filters**: Easily find recipes using applying filters based on custom tags for cuisine, dietary preferences, and more.

- **CRUD Operations**: Admin users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on recipes to keep the collection up to date.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using React with TypeScript. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the recipes.

- **Backend**: The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, serving as the API gateway for the frontend. It handles user authentication, recipe management, and database interactions.

- **Database**: MongoDB is used to store the recipe data, user profiles, and authentication tokens.
